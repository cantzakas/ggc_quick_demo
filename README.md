# Pivotal Gemfire-Greenplum Connector Demo
Quick demo on Pivotal Gemfire-Greenplum Connector setup, configuration & use

## Overview
The Pivotal GemFire速-Greenplum速 Connector facilitates the two way mirroring of the entries of an entire Pivotal GemFire速 region into a Pivotal Greenplum Database速 (GPDB) table and vice-versa.

## How it works
- All transfers are initiated from and specified within GemFire.
- Data copied from GemFire to GPDB makes use of the GemFire export functionality. 
- Data copied from GPDB to GemFire makes use of the GemFire import functionality. 
- The specification of mappings of tables within GPDB to regions in GemFire are within a GemFire cache.xml file. 
- Further mappings identify which GemFire fields are to be imported from or exported to GPDB table columns. 
- A subset of the fields and columns may be specified, and then only that subset are imported or exported.
